# Homework on Bass Model

This project analyzes global consumer spending on smart home technology and implements the **Bass Diffusion Model** to study adoption trends.

## üìÇ Project Structure

- `statistic_id693303_consumer_smart_home_spending_worldwide_2015_2025.xlsx`: The dataset containing consumer spending data from 2015 to 2025.
- `utility_functions.py`: Contains data processing and modeling functions.
- `DS223_HW1_Hayk_Nalchajyan.ipynb`: A Jupyter notebook implementing the analysis and modeling.
- `requirements.txt`: A list of dependencies required to run the project.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation

To set up the project, create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```sh
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt

```python
from utility_functions import load_smart_home_spending

df = load_smart_home_spending("statistic_id693303_consumer_smart_home_spending_worldwide_2015_2025.xlsx")
print(df.head())


```python
from utility_functions import bass_model
import numpy as np

t = np.arange(0, 11)  # Time in years
p, q, M = 0.03, 0.38, 100  # Example parameters
adoption = bass_model(t, p, q, M)
print(adoption)
